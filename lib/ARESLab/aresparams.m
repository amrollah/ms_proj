% aresparams
% Creates configuration for building ARES models. The structure is for
% further use with aresbuild, arescv, and arescvc functions.
%
% Call:
%   trainParams = aresparams(maxFuncs, c, cubic, cubicFastLevel, ...
%       selfInteractions, maxInteractions, threshold, prune, fastK, ...
%       fastBeta, fastH, useMinSpan, useEndSpan, maxFinalFuncs, ...
%       endSpanAdjust, newVarPenalty)
%
% All the input arguments of this function are optional. Empty values are
% also accepted (the corresponding default values will be used).
% Parameters c, prune, and maxFinalFuncs are used in the backward pruning
% phase. Parameter cubic can be used in both phases depending on
% cubicFastLevel. All other parameters are used in the forward phase only.
% For most applications, it can be expected that the most attention should
% be paid to the following parameters: maxFuncs, c, cubic, maxInteractions,
% and in some cases maxFinalFuncs. If Fast MARS algorithm is to be used,
% parameters fastK, fastBeta, and fastH should be looked at. It is quite
% possible that the default values for maxFuncs and maxInteractions will be
% far from optimal for your data.
%
% Input:
%   maxFuncs      : The maximum number of basis functions included in model
%                   in the forward building phase (before pruning in the
%                   backward phase). Includes the intercept term. The
%                   recommended value for this parameter is about two times
%                   the expected number of basis functions in the final
%                   model (Friedman, 1991a). Note that the algorithm may
%                   also not reach this number. This can happen when the
%                   number of coefficients in the model exceeds the number
%                   of observations in data or because of the threshold
%                   parameter. The default value for this parameter is -1
%                   in which case maxFuncs is calculated automatically
%                   using formula min(200, max(20, 2d)) + 1, where d is the
%                   number of input variables (Milborrow, 2015). This is
%                   fairly arbitrary but can be useful for first
%                   experiments.
%                   To enforce an upper bound on the final model size, use
%                   maxFinalFuncs instead. This is because the forward
%                   phase can see only one basis function ahead while the
%                   backward pruning phase can choose any of the built
%                   basis functions to include in the final model.
%   c             : Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) penalty per knot.
%                   Larger values for c will lead to fewer knots (i.e., the
%                   final model will have fewer basis functions). A value
%                   of 0 penalizes only terms, not knots (can be useful,
%                   e.g., with lots of data, low noise, and highly
%                   structured underlying function of the data). Generally,
%                   the choice of the value for c should greatly depend on
%                   size of the dataset, how structured is the underlying
%                   function, and how high is the noise level, and mildly
%                   depend on the thoroughness of the optimization
%                   procedure, i.e., on the parameters maxFuncs,
%                   maxInteractions, and useMinSpan (Friedman, 1991a).
%                   Simulation studies suggest values for c in the range of
%                   about 2 to 4 (Friedman, 1991a). The default value for
%                   this parameter is -1 in which case c is chosen
%                   automatically using the following rule: if
%                   maxInteractions = 1 (additive modelling) c = 2,
%                   otherwise c = 3. These are the values recommended by
%                   Friedman (Friedman, 1991a).
%   cubic         : Whether to use piecewise-cubic (true) or piecewise-
%                   linear (false) type of modelling. In general, it is
%                   expected that the piecewise-cubic modelling will give
%                   better predictive performance for smoother and less
%                   noisy data. (default value = true)
%   cubicFastLevel : aresbuild implements three levels of piecewise-cubic
%                   modelling. In level 0, cubic modelling for each
%                   candidate model is done in both phases of the method
%                   (slow). In level 1, cubic modelling is done only in the
%                   backward phase (much faster). In level 2, cubic
%                   modelling is done after both phases, only for the final
%                   model (fastest). The default and recommended level is 2
%                   (and it corresponds to the recommendations in
%                   Friedman's paper (Friedman, 1991a)). Levels 0 and 1 may
%                   bring extra accuracy in the situations when the
%                   underlying function of the data has sharp thresholds
%                   that require knot placements different that those
%                   required for piecewise-linear modelling.
%   selfInteractions : This is experimental feature. The maximum degree of
%                   self interactions for any input variable. It can be
%                   larger than 1 only for piecewise-linear modelling. The
%                   default, and recommended, value = 1, no self
%                   interactions.
%   maxInteractions : The maximum degree of interactions between input
%                   variables. Set to 1 for additive modelling (i.e., no
%                   interactions). For maximal interactivity between the
%                   variables, set the parameter to d * selfInteractions,
%                   where d is the number of input variables � this way the
%                   modelling procedure will have the most freedom building
%                   a complex model. Typically only a low degree of
%                   interaction is allowed, but higher degrees can be used
%                   when the data warrants it. (default value = 1)
%   threshold     : One of the stopping criteria for the forward phase (see
%                   remarks section of function aresbuild in user's manual
%                   for details). Default value = 1e-4. For noise-free
%                   data, the value may be lowered but setting it to 0 can
%                   cause numerical issues and instability.
%   prune         : Whether to perform model pruning (the backward phase).
%                   (default value = true)
%   fastK         : Parameter (integer) for Fast MARS algorithm (Friedman,
%                   1993, Section 3.0). Maximum number of parent basis
%                   functions considered at each step of the forward phase.
%                   Typical values for fastK are 20, 10, 5 (default value =
%                   Inf, i.e., no Fast MARS). With lower fastK values
%                   model building is faster at the expense of some
%                   accuracy. Good starting values for fast exploratory
%                   work are fastK = 20, fastBeta = 1, fastH = 5 (Friedman,
%                   1993). Friedman in his paper concluded that, while
%                   changing the values of fastK and fastH can have big
%                   effect on training computation times, predictive
%                   performance is largely unaffected over a wide range of
%                   their values (Friedman, 1993).
%   fastBeta      : Artificial ageing factor for Fast MARS algorithm
%                   (Friedman, 1993, Section 3.1). Typical value for
%                   fastBeta is 1 (default value = 0, i.e., no artificial
%                   ageing). The parameter is ignored if fastK = Inf.
%   fastH         : Parameter (integer) for Fast MARS algorithm (Friedman,
%                   1993, Section 4.0). Number of iterations till next full
%                   optimization over all input variables for each parent
%                   basis function. Higher values make the search faster.
%                   Typical values for fastH are 1, 5, 10 (default value =
%                   1, i.e., full optimization in every iteration).
%                   Computational reduction associated with increasing
%                   fastH is most pronounced for data sets with many input
%                   variables and when large fastK is used. There seems to
%                   be little gain in increasing fastH beyond 5 (Friedman,
%                   1993). The parameter is ignored if fastK = Inf.
%   useMinSpan    : In order to lower the local variance of the estimates,
%                   a minimum span is imposed that makes the method
%                   resistant to runs of positive or negative error values
%                   between knots (by jumping over a minSpan number of
%                   observations each time the next potential knot
%                   placement is requested) (Friedman, 1991a). useMinSpan
%                   allows to disable (set to 0 or 1) the protection so
%                   that all x values are considered for knot placement in
%                   each dimension (except, see useEndSpan). Disabling
%                   minSpan may allow creating a model which is more
%                   responsive to local variations in the data however this
%                   can also lead to overfitting. Setting the useMinSpan to
%                   >�1, enables to manually tune the value. (default and
%                   recommended value = -1 which corresponds to the
%                   automatic mode)
%   useEndSpan    : In order to lower the local variance of the estimates
%                   near the ends of data intervals, a minimum span is
%                   imposed that makes the method resistant to runs of
%                   positive or negative error values between extreme knot
%                   locations and the corresponding ends of data intervals
%                   (by not allowing to place a knot too near to the end of
%                   data interval) (Friedman, 1991a). useEndSpan allows to
%                   disable (set to 0) the protection so that all the
%                   observations are considered for knot placement in each
%                   dimension (except, see useMinSpan). Disabling endSpan
%                   may allow creating a model which is more responsive to
%                   local variations in the data however this can also lead
%                   to a model that is overfitted near the edges of the
%                   data. Setting the useMinSpan to >�1, enables to
%                   manually tune the value. (default and recommended
%                   value = -1 which corresponds to the automatic mode)
%   maxFinalFuncs : Maximum number of basis functions (including the
%                   intercept term) in the pruned model. Use this (rather
%                   than the maxFuncs parameter) to enforce an upper bound
%                   on the final model size. (default value = Inf)
%   endSpanAdjust : For basis functions with variable interactions, endSpan
%                   gets multiplied by this value. This reduces probability
%                   of getting overfitted interaction terms supported by
%                   just a few observations on the boundaries of data
%                   intervals. Still, at least one knot will always be
%                   allowed in the middle, even if endSpanAdjust would
%                   prohibit it. Useful values range from 1 to 10. (default
%                   value = 1, i.e., no adjustment)
%   newVarPenalty : Penalty for adding a new variable to a model in the
%                   forward phase. This is the gamma parameter of Eq. 74 in
%                   the original paper (Friedman, 1991a). The higher is the
%                   penalty, the more reluctant will be the forward phase
%                   to add a new variable to the model - it will rather try
%                   to use variables already in the model. This can be
%                   useful when some of the variables are highly collinear.
%                   As a result, the final model may be easier to interpret
%                   although usually the built models also will have worse
%                   predictive performance. Useful non-zero values
%                   typically range from 0.01 to 0.2 (Milborrow, 2015).
%                   (default value = 0, i.e., no penalty)
%
% Output:
%   trainParams   : A structure of parameters for further use with
%                   aresbuild, arescv, and arescvc functions containing the
