/* Hello. This file is made for easing up the debugging process of the algorithm. You'll see that most of the variables' names follow a structure.
This list here is intended to cover the most frequently used variable naming conventions. 
Note that the list is not exhaustive.

Cs: Clear sky
att: attribute
Occ: occlusion 
irr: irradiance reading
DB: database
est: estimation
th: threshold
Temp: temperature
CBH/cbh: Cloud Base Height
GHI: Global Horizontal Irradiance 
Proj: same variable projected on real world coordinates (x,y,z). Otherwise on image plane (u,v)
Obs: observed
rwc: real world coordinates


Note: timeseries function in MATLAB takes a long time (several seconds) given the data is long.

OTHER ABBREVIATIONS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
CBH: Cloud Base Height
GHI: Global Horizontal Irradiance
NWP: Numerical Weather Prediction (not used)
CSL: Clear Sky Library
SP: Sunshine Parameter
RBR: Red to Blue Ratio
R-B: Red to Blue difference
LCL: Lifting Condensation Level (same as CBH): 1500m for now.
