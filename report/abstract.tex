Managing fluctuation in renewable power is one of the big challenges that need to be solved in order to significantly increase the penetration of renewables into the power grid. For photovoltaics, one possible approach to predict short term variations is vision based. Such systems have been studied for about 5 years, and the state of the art is a fish eye camera pointing into the sky and taking image sequences. Given such image sequences and their extrapolation into the near future, the aim of this Master Thesis project is to develop and compare algorithms to predict the short term power production of a PV plant, making use of Image Processing and Machine Learning. Specifically, the role of the cloudiness predictions in both shielding the direct sun irradiation and reflecting the sunlight (increasing the diffuse component) needs to be addressed.
