\begin{abstract}
This work would not have been possible without the support, guidance and ideas of my supervisor Dr. Poland. Also, I would like to thank ABBcompany for providing me with the infrastructure, data, and human support which allowed me to conduct my thesis in an inductrial enviroment. Last but not least, I thank my mentor and supervisor at ETH, Prof. Marc Pollefeys who facilitated this oppurtunity for me and agreed on evaluating my thesis report.
