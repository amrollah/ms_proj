\begin{abstract}
This work would not have been possible without the support, guidance and ideas of my supervisor Dr. Jan Poland. Also, I would like to thank ABB company for providing me with the infrastructure, data, and human support which allowed me to conduct my thesis in an industrial environment. Last but not least, I thank my mentor and supervisor at ETH, Prof. Marc Pollefeys who facilitated this opportunity for me and agreed on evaluating my thesis report.
